A python library for vaultwarden

## Clients

There are 2 clients:

- One for the vaultwarden admin API, that needs to be authenticated with the admin token
- One for the bitwarden API, that needs to be authenticated with the user api keys or user's mail and password.

The `reset_account` and `transfer_account_rights` from the Admin client needs a valid Bitwarden client to re-invite the
target user.

## Credits

The cryptographic part is handled by the [bitwardentools library](https://github.com/corpusops/bitwardentools).
